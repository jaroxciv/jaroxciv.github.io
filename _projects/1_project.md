## Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade, fully modular LLM-based SQL Agent** for natural language question answering over a real relational database.

**Key features:**

- Ask business questions in natural language â€” get real SQL queries and concise, interpretable summaries.
- Powered by OpenAI or Mistral LLMs, running via [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- **Database:** Uses the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) demo database in PostgreSQL, with full schema introspection and human-readable notes on table relationships.
- Provides business insights, analysis summaries, and automatically interprets the SQL output for non-technical users.

## Example Use Cases

## Technical Stack

- **LangGraph**: stateful multi-node workflow orchestration
- **PostgreSQL**: for both demo data (Chinook) and LLM memory/persistence
- **Streamlit**: live, interactive frontend
- **SQLAlchemy**: schema and data introspection
- **Pydantic**: strict models for schema/inputs
- **Modern LLMs**: Mistral, OpenAI, or plug your own
- **Docker**: local development, with easy launch of database and pgAdmin
