Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by.

I'm Javier Alfaro, a geospatial data scientist and AI engineer based in London, currently developing advanced geospatial and AI solutions at [GeoKapti](https://www.geokapti.nl/). My background blends Geographic Data Science, Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning for urban analytics and spatial intelligence.

I believe in the power of open science, reproducibility, and building practical tools to support planners, researchers, and cities worldwide. If you'd like to chat, collaborate, or just geek out about GeoAI, feel free to drop me an email!
